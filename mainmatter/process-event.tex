\section*{Material flow in a process design}
This scenario demonstrates how to represent a SysML/UML activity diagram in an IOF Ontology.
Basically, how to show the material flow, i.e., the input and output of the processes.
The use case should include raw materials as input in the first step, intermediate material entities, and the final product, utilizing hasInput and hasOutput along with raw material and product roles.


% \section*{Process Design and Conformance}
%  Here discuss how to classify time stamped events automatically as making coffee.
