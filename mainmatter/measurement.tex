\section{Unitless measurements}
count, percentage. ratio

\section{Multiple measurements of the same object at the same time}
different measurement processes 

\subsection*{Scenario Objective}

This scenario demonstrates how to represent measurements conducted on different attributes of the same material entity within the context of the \textbf{BFO/IOF ontology}.

\subsection*{Key Points}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This pattern demonstrates how to capture and represent various attributes (e.g., physical, chemical, mechanical) measured on the same material entity.
    \item The pattern demonstrates the temporal coincidence of different measurements.
     \item The pattern highlights how measurements of various attributes can be traced back to the same material entity by using the IOF Core
\end{itemize}

\section{Time-series measurement}
(process characteristics)

\section{uncertainty, range of values}
if time permits
