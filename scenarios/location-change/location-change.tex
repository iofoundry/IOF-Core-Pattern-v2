\subsection*{Scenario Objective}

This scenario depicts how to express the change of an object's location over time using IOF/BFO ontology.

\begin{itemize}
    \item  Clarify what we mean by location: physical location.
    \item Specify the type of location covered by this pattern.
    \item Note: This pattern does not show future changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{General Pattern Description}

\subsubsection*{Use Case: Freight Train Location Change} 
A freight train operated by BNSF Railway hauls coal from Powder River Basin, Wyoming, to the Port of Long Beach in California. It was located at Powder River Basin station at 11:00 AM on Wednesday and then at Long Beach station at midnight on Thursday.

\subsubsection*{Use-Case Pattern Description}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The train \texttt{ns1:freight-train} is located at (\texttt{bfo:locatedInAtSomeTime}) two different locations: \texttt{ns1:powder-river-basin} and \texttt{ns1:long-beach-port}, both of which are instances of \texttt{bfo:site}.
    \item Two separate instances of \texttt{bfo:SpatialRegion}: \texttt{ns1:spatial-region-powder-river-basin} and \texttt{ns1:spatial-region-long-beach}.
    \item The sites are linked to the spatial regions by \texttt{occupiesSpatialRegionAtAllTimes}.
    \item Temporal instants are linked to the sites, but the actual clock times are omitted for brevity.
\end{itemize}

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{|X|l|X|X|X|}
\hline
Train Number & Source & Destination & Departure Time & Arrival Time \\
\hline
1            & Powder River Basin & Long Beach      & 11:00 AM      & Midnight       \\
2            & Example Source     & Example Dest    & 10:00 AM      & 2:00 PM        \\
3            & Example Source 2   & Example Dest 2  & 8:00 AM       & 4:00 PM        \\
