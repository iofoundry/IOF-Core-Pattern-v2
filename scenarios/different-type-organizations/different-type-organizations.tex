\subsection*{Scenario Objective}
This scenario illustrates how to represent a complete company structure with manufacturing and business divisions using the IOF core ontology. It focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showing how business and manufacturing units coexist within one company
    \item Distinguishing between business and manufacturing activities
    \item Capturing different organizational roles and functions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{General Pattern Description}
A company can contain both business organizations and manufacturers as part of its structure.
An \cname{iof}{Organization} can simultaneously be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An \cname{iof}{BusinessOrganization} that has an \cname{iof}{BusinessFunction}, which is realized through an \cname{iof} {SellingBusinessProcess} that sells the \cname{iof}{MaterialProduct}
    \item An \cname{iof}{Manufacturer} that has an \cname{iof}{ManufacturerRole}, which is realized through an \cname{iof} {ProductProductionProcess} that  has an \cname{iof}{MaterialProduct} as its output.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Use Case: }

This use case demonstrates how a company like GE operates as both a manufacturer and a business organization using the same material products.

\subsubsection*{Use-Case Pattern Description}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{scenarios/different-type-organizations/image/different-type-organizations}

GE Aerospace (\iname{ns1}{ge-aerospace}) operates as both an organization (\cname{iof}{Organization}) and a business organization (\cname{iof}{BusinessOrganization}) with respect to jet engines (\cname{ns1}{jet-engine}). Through its manufacturing division (\iname{ns1}{ge-manufacturer}), which is \opname{bfo}{continuantPartOfAtAllTimes} GE Aerospace, it bears a manufacturer role (\iname{ns1}{jet-engine-production-role}) which it \opname{bfo}{realizes} through a production process (\iname{ns1}{jet-engine-production-process}) that (\opname{iof}{hasOutput}) a jet engine (\iname{ns1}{jet-engine}). The organization also has a business function (\iname{ns1}{jet-engine-selling-function}) which it \opname{bfo}{realizes} through a selling process (\iname{ns1}{jet-engine-selling-process}), where the same jet engines are sold (\opname{bfo}{hasParticipantAtSomeTime}) in the selling process.
