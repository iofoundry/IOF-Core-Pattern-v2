\subsection*{Scenario Objective}
This scenario illustrates how to represent a complete company structure with manufacturing and business divisions using the IOF core ontology. It focuses on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Showing how business and manufacturing units coexist within one company
    \item Distinguishing between business and manufacturing activities
    \item Capturing different organizational roles and functions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{General Pattern Description}
A company can contain both business organizations and manufacturers as part of its structure.
An Organization can simultaneously be:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A BusinessOrganization that has a BusinessFunction, which is realized through a SellingBusinessProcess that sells the MaterialProduct
    \item A Manufacturer that has a ManufacturerRole, which is realized through a ProductProductionProcess and  has the MaterialProduct as its output.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Use Case: }

This use case demonstrates how a company like GE operates as both a manufacturer and a business organization using the same material products.

\subsubsection*{Use-Case Pattern Description}
\includegraphics[scale=0.35]{scenarios/different-type-organizations/image/different-type-organizations}

GE Aerospace (\texttt{ns1:ge-aerospace}) operates as both an organization (\texttt{iof:Organization}) and a business organization (\texttt{iof:BusinessOrganization}) with respect to jet engines (\texttt{ns1:jet-engine}). Through its manufacturing division (\texttt{ns1:ge-manufacturer}), which is \texttt{bfo:continuantPartOfAtAllTimes} of GE Aerospace, it bears a manufacturer role (\texttt{ns1:jet-engine-production-role}) which is \texttt{bfo:realize} through a production process (\texttt{ns1:jet-engine-production-process}), producing jet engines as \texttt{iof:hasOutput}. The organization also has a business function (\texttt{ns1:jet-engine-selling-function}) which is \texttt{bfo:realize} through a selling process (\texttt{ns1:jet-engine-selling-process}), where the same jet engines are sold (\texttt{bfo:hasParticipantAtSomeTime}) in the selling process.
