address all times/ sometimes and also transitivity of these two pairs of relationships.

\subsection*{Scenario Objective}
From Arko's email, 1/7/25 
I want to mention that however we are showing the basic use of "component part of" relation for expressing parthood, we should also show the use of "at some time" vs. "at all times" under this scenario. Also, the nuanced semantics of "component of at all times" vs. "has component at all times" (explain why they are not inverses to each other) is to be examined.

We also need to show multiple levels of assemblies, at least three. Should we consider assembly process(es)?

\subsection*{Examples}

A car engine is often showcased in parts: pistons, crankshaft, and cylinders.

An insulated wall comprises drywall, insulation foam, and outer sheathing.

Sewing patches of silk, cotton and leather make an item of clothing.
