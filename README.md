# IOF Core Patterns Compendium

## Overview
Welcome to the IOF Core Patterns Compendium repository. This project provides a collection of reusable and well-documented ontology patterns for industrial data modeling, based on the IOF Core vocabulary. These patterns aim to assist data modelers and developers in mapping legacy data and addressing common industrial knowledge graph scenarios using IOF Core principles.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to:

* Develop small, repetitive fragments of a knowledge graph * *(patterns) for real-life data modeling.
* Provide a practical guide for implementing IOF Core in industrial scenarios.
* Enable developers to create consistent, reusable, and validated data mappings using IOF Core.
